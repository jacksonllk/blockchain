# 2) Add another option to your user interface: The user should be able to 
#   output the data stored in the file in the terminal.




# 3) Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to the file) 
#   and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle and json.




# 4) Adjust the logic to load the file content to work with pickled/ json data.
